Title: Intelligent Brain Tumor Detection Using U-Net and Computer Vision

Project Summary:
This project focuses only developing an AI-powered solution for detecting and segmenting brain tumors from MRI scans. Leveraging the U-Net convolutional neural network architecture alongside traditional image processing techniques, the system enhances the speed and accuracy of tumor localizationâ€”critical for supporting clinical decisions in radiology.

Core Components:

Deep Learning Backbone:
  Utilizes U-Net, a specialized CNN architecture tailored for biomedical image segmentation. It excels in capturing context and fine details for pixel-wise tumor detection. Image Processing Pipeline:

   Input normalization and contrast enhancement
  Noise reduction using Gaussian filters
  Region segmentation using both contour-based and deep learning methods
   Post-processing to refine tumor boundaries Interactive Visualization:
  A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit, enabling medical staff to upload MRI scans, view segmentation overlays, and download results.

Tools and Technologies: Python, NumPy, OpenCV TensorFlow/Keras for model implementation Streamlit for front-end deploymentMRI datasets (e.g., BraTS, if applicable)

Skills Developed:Deep learning for image segmentation Biomedical image processing fundamentals End-to-end application development for healthcare Integration of AI models into real-time, interactive web apps

Healthcare Impact:
By automating brain tumor segmentation, this solution reduces diagnostic workload and enhances detection precision, serving as a valuable aid to radiologists and healthcare practitioners in early-stage tumor identification
